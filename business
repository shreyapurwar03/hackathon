            <p> The business playing field has changed a lot in the past decade. Business careers for women are opening up every day, and more women are starting their own businesses. Research from Guidant Financial and LendingClub notes that there was a 58 percent uptick in businesses run by women between 2007 and 2018, and 4 out of every 10 small businesses are now owned by women. And according to Catalyst, there's at least one woman in senior management in 87 percent of global businesses.

            <h2><mark>Financial analyst</mark> </h2>
    
            <p>Financial analyst is one of the highest-paying jobs for women, per <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/careers/the-20-highest-paying-jobs-for-women/articleshow/49496385.cms">BUsiness Insider</a>  , which extrapolated data from the U.S. Census Bureaus 2017 American Community Survey. Financial analysts help businesses make important investment decisions. They usually have a bachelor's degree in business administration, accounting, or a related field of study that included courses in business, economics, financial management, and statistics. Business Insider estimates the median salary for women in financial analyst positions is around $71,000 a year.  </p>

            <h2><mark>Human resources specialist</mark></h2>
    
            <p>Human resources specialists are responsible for filling job openings, advocating for employees, and training and developing employees, among other tasks. They might even travel to job fairs to recruit and interview candidates. This role requires empathy, coaching skills, and organization—qualities in which women outperform men, according to the Korn Ferry study. The first step toward becoming a human resources specialist is to earn a <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/online-business-degrees/human-resources-bachelors-program.html">bachelor’s degree in human resource</a> management or business administration. Even with a degree, candidates might need to have some analogous work experience, such as customer service work or an office job. Human resources specialists earn about $55,000 a year, PayScale says.</p>

            <h2> <mark>Health services manager</mark> </h2>
    
            <p> Health services managers perform administrative duties for healthcare providers. Besides a <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/online-business-degrees/healthcare-management-bachelors-program.html">bachelor's degree in healthcare management or business administration</a>, prospective health services managers will need entry-level administrative experience in a healthcare environment. (Volunteer work at a hospital or private healthcare facility could be helpful.) The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that health services managers make about $100,000 a year, on average, and predicts that the employment rate will increase 18 percent by 2028.</p>
